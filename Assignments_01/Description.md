### 1. Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your program’s inputs should be:
• The cost of a new car <br>
• The estimated miles driven per year <br>
• The estimated gas price <br>
• The efficiency in miles per gallon <br>
• The estimated resale value after 5 years <br><br>
Implement a HybridCar class and compute the total cost of owning the car for five years. (For simplicity, we will not take the cost of financing into account.) <br><br>
**[Score Criteria]**
- Comments in javadoc format for all classes and methods [0.5pt]
- Defining the appropriate instance variables [1pt]
- Implementing for setting and accessing methods about all instance variables
(including constructors) [0.5pt]
- Providing test class containing a main method [1pt]
- Output appropriateness of output results including format (submission with external
report) [1pt]
- Code accuracy with the various input cases [1pt]

### 2. In this project, you will perform calculations with triangles. A triangle is defined by the x- and y-coordinates of its three corner points. Your job is to compute the following properties of a given triangle:

• the lengths of all sides <br>
• the angles at all corners <br>
• the perimeter <br>
• the area <br><br>
Implement a Triangle class with appropriate methods. Supply a program that
prompts a user for the corner point coordinates and produces a nicely formatted table of the triangle properties.<br><br>
